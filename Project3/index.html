682 Project Introductions---Book Cycle
<p>
In this project I plan to design a tool to provide a platform for stduents to exchange their books.
</p>
Here is the <a href = "doxygen/index.html"> <font size="5">Doxygen </font> </a>page
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p>
<p></p>
In this project, I try to combine internal database and external database together. 
<p></p>
<p></p>
The external database includes the following table: Users, Books and Borrow. The borrow table control the action between Books and Users. The detail can be seen in the database schema. The main function of external database is managing all the users and books. 
The internal database includes the following table: localUser, localBook and History. The main function of internal database is trying to remember the users’ search action. Here we call it history. 
<p></p>
<p></p>
As you can see from the name of the table, the internal database just conclude the users which use this iPhone. Also, it will remember the record the books which have already searched by local users. The connection between these two databases is: the internal database is concluded by external database which means the users belong to internal database must belong to the external database. The vise is not.
<p></p>
<p></p>
The main function of this application is:
<p></p>
<p></p>
<li>1.	Login system. (check whether this user exist on the server)</li>
<li>2.	Sign up system. (new user could been seen )</li>
<li>3.	Search the book system. (search the book system)</li>
<li>4.	Borrow system. (you can input the days you want to borrow and see the value you should pay for that)</li>
<li>5.	Book detail system. (you could see whether it has already be borrowed)</li>
<li>6.	See the history which this user searched on this device. (also include the clear function )</li>
<p></p>
<p></p>
Coming soon:
<p></p>
<p></p>
<li>1.	The user can modify his/her profile</li>
<li>2.	The user can see this book’s history and borrowing his/her history</li>
<li>3.	The owner can do the operation whether he/she accept the request sent by borrower</li>
<li>4.	More safety design</li>

 



PS: This project still needs a great improvement
