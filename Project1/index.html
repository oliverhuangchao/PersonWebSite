682 Project Introductions
<p>
In this project, I design a card game I named it "Search for the head".
The first screen you will see is 
</p>
<p></p> 
<p></p> 

You will see 15 cards on the deck.  Then click each card like this,
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
The rule is clicking the card one by one. Each clip will flip a card and show a rand card to the user. Here we only focus on the rank of the card. Once two cardsâ€™ ranks are equal, all the cards between these two cards will disappear. The total step count will be calculated. See how luck you are. Theoretically the luckiest count is two. Just clip two cards and then win the game.
I also add several functions in this game
<li>You can input the total number of cards in this game. Such as you can input 5 which means five cards in the game. If among these five cards, you still cannot win the game. The game will be over. Like this,</li>
 
<li>You can then click the start button to restart the game. Then you can reset the total number of joined cards or remain the number in last time. By the way, at the beginning the total number of cards is 15.</li>

<li>The game will tell how many open cards are now in the deck and your current total game.</li>

Thanks:
Thanks for my grader's Joshua's help. He help me to finish a very important step which is stay the last correct card on the deck for 1s. That is really important, because I need the user see that he/she has already click two same cards on the deck. Using an NSTime class, we successfully finish that. Thanks for his help.
